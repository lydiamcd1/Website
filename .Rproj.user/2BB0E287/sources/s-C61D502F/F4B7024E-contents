In Python, regular expressions are a tool used to locate certain characters, and be able to edit them. This can be useful in data science applications for example, to locate strings and standardize them.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
import pandas
import re

```
A useful first function to know is re.findall() into which you input your target expression and the string you want to be searched. It exports a list of strings, with every string being a located match. 
```{python}
str= "I want to learn python and learn regex!"
match = re.findall(r'learn', str)
print(match)
```

The regular expression pattern was the characters in the specific order 'learn', which occurred twice in the string, so it was printed twice in the output.
For specific alphanumeric characters, that letter in the alphabet can just be put in the findall function. For special characters such as '!' or '^', a backslash must be typed before it.
```{python}
match1= re.findall(r'\!', str)
print(match1)
```
Here I used the backslash to find the '!', which only occurred once.

Some useful symbols are: '.' which matches any character, '\\w' which matches any alphanumeric character, and '\\d' which matches any numeric digit. 
To indicate how many times a certain character is wanted, a '+' indicates 1 or more instances, and a '*' indicates 0 or more instances. 

```{python}
string= "A bug bugged the schoolbus."
match2= re.findall(r'bu\w+', string)
print(match2)
```
Here, any instance of the characters 'bu' followed by any alphanumeric character ('\\w') occurring once or more ('+') was found. This meant that 'bug', 'bugged', and 'bus' all met this criteria and were located in the string. 

I hope this was a useful introduction to regex and you are inspired to keep learning!
