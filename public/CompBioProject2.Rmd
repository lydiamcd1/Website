*Airquality shows Air Quality Index measures (Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Particulate Matter < 2.5 micrometers in size) all collected at Noon from January 2018, daily through the end of March 2018 in North West Austin by TCEQ continuous collection equipment. Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, and Nitrogen Dioxide are measured in parts per billion, while Particulate Matter is measured in micrograms per cubic meter.* 
*Temperature shows the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit collected by TCEQ equipment at Noon daily from January 2018, through the end of March 2018 in North West Austin.* 
*This data was originally all stored separately from each other on the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality website in a non-excel format- I compiled the 5 datasets into 2 separate excel datsets.*
*I also added the categorial variable "Month", with 3 levels, Jan, Feb, and Mar for which month the data was collected in. I divided Ozone into two levels to create a binary variable- 1= High (above average), and 0= Low (below average)*
*There were a few small negative values that were explained as something that could happen in routine contitions.*

#I performed 1 MANOVA, 5 ANOVA, and 12 t-tests.
#The chance of a type 1 error is 0.05*18= 0.9
#Bonferroni correction: alpha= 0.05/18= 0.0028 as significance level.
#The significant differences: Ozone between Jan/Feb, Jan/Mar, and Feb/Mar, NitrogenDioxide between Jan/Mar and Feb/Mar, PM2.5 between Jan/Feb and Jan/Mar, and Temp between Jan/Mar and Feb/Mar. 

#Assumptions for MANOVA were likely not met, as they are very specific, for ANOVA the assumptions for normality, large sample, and independent sample were likely met, but probably not equal variance because for each month the variance could be different. For the t-test, all the assumptions were likely met as they are similar to ANOVA.

*Null hypothesis: There is no correlation between temperature and ozone level. Alternative hypothesis: There is correlation. Interpretation: The p-value is 0.00015, which is less than 0.05, thus the null hypothesis is rejected, and there is a correlation between these two variables.*

#Coefficient interpretation: For average temperature and PM2.5, the predicted Ozone level is 31.4 ppm. For average PM2.5, a one degree increase in temperature increases Ozone by 0.49 ppm. For average temperature, a one microgram/m^3 increase in PM2.5 decreases Ozone by 1.23 ppm. The effect of PM2.5 on Ozone, causes a difference in slope of 0.061 across different temperatures.

#The more robust standard errors made Temp_c and the Temp_c:PM2.5_c interaction slightly more significant, while making PM2.5_c less significant. Thus, the effect of temperature and PM2.5 on Ozone are both significant. Also now the effect of PM2.5 on Ozone varies signficantly across different temperatures.
